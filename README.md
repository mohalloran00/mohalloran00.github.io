## GitHub Pages with React

To initialize:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `cd react-vite`.
3. Run `npm install`.

For a responsive page while editing, run `npm run dev`. When you are finished with edits, run `npm run build` to save changes to the real index page. For either command to work, you must be in the `react-vite` directory.
